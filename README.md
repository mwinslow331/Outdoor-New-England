Outdoor New England 

I moved up to the Boston Area several years ago and didn't really know a lot of
people who enjoyed camping, skiing, kayaking, etc. This is where I came
about my idea for this project.

Outdoor New England is regionally based, for now, and designed to connect users
with others who share that passion. Users are able to sign in using their Google
account with Google's omniauth gemfile. Once the user is signed in they are able
to see different events other users have created or create their own.

As users join events they will be taken to screen with a list of items that are
needed for that event and mark off those items as something they will be
bringing with them (so as to prevent multiple people using valuable car space
to bring extra grills or tables).

The application was built using Ruby on the back end, mostly Rails on the front
end with some React components on the front end as well.
